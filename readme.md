**ImageAI is a Dall-E clone website made using ReactJS, TailwindCSS and OpenAI's Dall-E API.**

In ImageAI, a user can see the Community Showcase, where all the images generated by all the users along with their details are showcased.

A user can also create their own AI generated image using the `Create` button on the top right corner, where they will be redirected to the Create Post page.

## Home Page | Community Showcase

This is where all the finalized images will be showcased by all the users. Details of a particular image such as the *user* who created it, the *prompt* with which it was created, and the *download* icon can be viewed by hovering over the image.

The image can be downloaded simply by clicking on the download icon of any image.
